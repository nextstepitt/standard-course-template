        A foreword is generally written by a well-known and respected figure.
        The writer of the foreword will generally have background or relevant experience with the topic of the book, and
        can support why the author was the right person to produce this material.
        Forewords are a good way to gain more authority for your book, when readers recognize and respect who wrote it.

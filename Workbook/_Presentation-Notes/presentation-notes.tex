% Chapter-by-chapter, topic-by-topic notes for the presenter. We add these to the end of the printed book, so
% all the participants can find them too. Do not put anything in here that you do not want the participants to see, and
% it is generally a good practice not to hide anything from the students. In the case of giving the instructor
% an answer or explaining to them to keep something back until the right time, it is OK to put that kind of
% stuff in here. We do not keep any real secrets from the participants, those are just teaching techniques.
%
% Keep the section and subsections hidden using *, we do not want this in the table of contents.
